Smyrna was a thriving Roman seaport that [[Homer\|Homer]] called home and [[the temple of Athena\|the temple of Athena]] stood. The city also had an influential minority of prosperous Jewish merchants that were hostile to the Christian community there. [[Polycarp\|Polycarp]] was their bishop in 155 A.D. before he was martyred by the Romans.

The church in Smyrna was one of the two churches that wasn’t rebuked and were praised because of their faithfulness. Jesus only had two things to say to them–continue to be fearless and remain faithful ([[../../../Sources/ReadItLater Inbox/Seven Churches of Revelation Bible Study\|David Jeremiah Blog]]). He warned them that there were more trials coming and some would be imprisoned. He knew each and every person, Jew or Gentile, who blasphemed His name, and He remembered those who praised and honored Him. For true Christians, our reward is the crown of life, so we don’t need to fear the tests of life that come every day. Death itself is harmless to those wearing the crown of life.
