Smyrna was a city full of Jews who were hostile to Christians ([[Sources/The WEB Bible/Acts/Acts 14#2\|Acts 14:2]], [[Sources/The WEB Bible/Acts/Acts 14#19\|19]]; [[Sources/The WEB Bible/Acts/Acts 17#13\|Acts 17:13]]), yet despite repeated attacks and poverty, the Christians there thrived spiritually. And because of their faithfulness, Christ warned them that there were more trials coming and some would be imprisoned.
