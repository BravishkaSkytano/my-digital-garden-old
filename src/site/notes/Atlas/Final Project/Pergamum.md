Pergamum was an extremely pagan city, even Jesus wrote that it contained "Satan's throne".[^1] Some of the church members followed false teachings and compromised both religiously and morally. Jesus told them that if they repented, He would give them "hidden manna"[^2] and they would become like a "white stone" in His kingdom.
