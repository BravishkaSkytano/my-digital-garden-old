## Hello World!
I go by many names, Bravishka, Mystake, Virtuous Student, as well as my real one, you can learn more [about me here](https://bravishkaskytano.gitlab.io/about/). But no matter what name you know me by, this is my beautiful, and sometimes messy, [[+/zettelkasten\|zettelkasten]] full of knowledge that interests me. It was built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden), as well as [[+/my favorite Obsidian plugins\|my favorite Obsidian plugins]].

You're welcome to explore, just don't complain too much if (when) it gets chaotic. And who knows, maybe you will learn something cool, and we can talk about it together next time we meet.
## Note Icons
Before you pick a map and pick a path, I should probably explain the little icons that each section of my garden carries (don't worry, this won't take long). Those icons are just there to let you know how developed that zone is. There are currently only 3 stages: seedling, sapling, and tree.
### Seedlings

These are zones still under development. You probably won't see most of the little seedlings, but there are a few that have a kind of beauty in this stage.
### Saplings
![](/img/tree-2.svg)

Congratulations! You have been introduced to some of the young trees in my garden, and yes, there are a lot of them. Most of the zones here feature saplings. These notes are a bit more connected and generally make sense, but they still have some more growing to do.
### Trees
![](/img/tree-3.svg)

There are not that many trees in my garden (yet). These are the zones that are either big and don't require much development, or ones I don't need to nurture much; they only require some small up-keeping work.
## Atlas
There are a few different maps for this garden, each one tailored for the area of the garden that interests you the most. Go ahead and pick one, enjoy!
