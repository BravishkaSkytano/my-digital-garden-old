> Social science is the study of human behavior, relationships, and social phenomena. It often involves the study of human culture, society, and institutions, and the methods used to study social science can be more varied and less standardized than those used in natural science. Social scientists may use a combination of empirical evidence, historical analysis, and critical interpretation to develop and test theories about human behavior and social phenomena. Some of the main sub-categories of social sciences include:
> 
> 1. Anthropology: the study of human societies and cultures, both past and present.
> 2. Economics: the study of how individuals, businesses, and societies make choices about allocating resources to meet their needs and wants.
> 3. Political Science: the study of political systems, institutions, and behaviors.
> 4. Psychology: the scientific study of the mind and behavior, including human development, personality, and mental processes.
> 5. Sociology: the study of human social behavior, relationships, and institutions.
> 6. Human Geography: the study of the relationship between people, culture, and the natural environment.
> 7. Archaeology: the study of human history and prehistory through the examination of material remains.
> 8. Linguistics: the scientific study of language and its structure.
> 
> These sub-categories are not mutually exclusive, and many social scientists work in interdisciplinary fields that combine elements of multiple sub-categories.
> 
> The main difference between [[10-19 School/13 Science/13 Science\|science]] and social science lies in the subject and the methods used to study it. In short, while science studies the natural world, social science studies the human world, and the methods used in each field reflect the unique challenges and opportunities presented by their respective subject matters.
