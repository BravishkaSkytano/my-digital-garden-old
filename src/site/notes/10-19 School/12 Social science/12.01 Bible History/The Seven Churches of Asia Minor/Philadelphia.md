Philadelphia was founded by King Attalus II of [[10-19 School/12 Social science/12.01 Bible History/The Seven Churches of Asia Minor/Pergamum\|Pergamum]] in 150 B.C. and became known as the “[[Gateway to the East\|Gateway to the East]].” Its trademark consisted of grapes, textiles, and leather goods. And during the Byzantine times, it became an important center of Christianity.

It was the second of the two churches that received no condemnation from Jesus, instead Jesus spoke about the people of the local church and its potential, principles, and priorities. Like [[10-19 School/12 Social science/12.01 Bible History/The Seven Churches of Asia Minor/Smyrna\|Smyrna]], the Jewish community in Philadelphia was very hostile to Christians, yet the Christians remained faithful even with their weaknesses. Jesus opened doors for them and promised that one day their enemies would see the truth and praise His followers. Jesus condemned all of Philadelphia’s persecutors and promised to protect the church from the “hour of trial.” The followers of Christ are the pillars of God’s temple and carry the names of God, His city Jerusalem, and Jesus.
