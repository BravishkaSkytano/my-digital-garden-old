###### 8
Thus the goat became very great, but at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off, and four prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven.

</div></div>


The four horns represented the four kingdoms of the Diadochi:
1. Macedonia and Greece, ruled by Cassander
2. Thrace, Bithynia, and most of Asia Minor, ruled by Lysimachus
3. Syria, Babylon and the rest of the east, ruled by Seleucus
4. Egypt and possibly Palestine and Arabia Petraea, ruled by Ptolemy
