# Description
This course is designed to introduce you to the book of Daniel and Revelation. In this course we
will look into the themes and theology of these prophetic masterpieces. This class will be an
in-depth study of the books in a verse-by-verse format, in hopes that learners can better
understand what God has to say to us. Topics to be covered include the Person of Jesus Christ,
the rapture of the church, the Great Tribulation, the Antichrist, the return of Jesus Christ to the
earth, and the millennial reign of Christ.
