Ephesus was a prominent commercial and cultural center.[^1] In [[Sources/The WEB Bible/Revelation/Rev 2\|Revelation 2]], Jesus calls it the church that had abandoned the love and passion they had to serve Him in the beginning. Even though they were hard-working and constantly testing and rebuking false prophets, they were no longer doing it for the right reasons. They had forgotten that truth and love go together.
