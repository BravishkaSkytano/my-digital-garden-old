Pergamum was an extremely pagan city, even Jesus wrote that it contained "Satan's throne".[^1] Some of the church members followed false teachings and compromised both religiously and morally. Jesus told them that if they repented, He would give them "hidden manna" and they would become like a "white stone" in His kingdom.[^2]
