From Ancient Greek εἰς (eis, “into”) and English [[+/Exegesis\|Exegesis]]. Historically unrelated to the Ancient Greek εἰσήγησις (eisḗgēsis, “proposing, advising”).

An interpretation, especially of Scripture, that reflects the personal ideas or viewpoint of the interpreter; reading something into a text that is not there.
