> **(8)** The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky.

The four horns represented the four kingdoms of the Diadochi:
1. Macedonia and Greece, ruled by Cassander
2. Thrace, Bithynia, and most of Asia Minor, ruled by Lysimachus
3. Syria, Babylon and the rest of the east, ruled by Seleucus
4. Egypt and possibly Palestine and Arabia Petraea, ruled by Ptolemy
