> **(9)** Out of one of them came out a little horn, which grew exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land. 
> **(10)** It grew great, even to the army of the sky; and it cast down some of the army and of the stars to the ground, and trampled on them.

Most of the controversy of this vision is due to the "little horn."" Refers to Syria with Egypt being "the south," ancient Medo-Persia or Armenia being "the east" and Israel or Canaan, or more specifically Jerusalem as the "glorious land."

This is fulfilled by [[+/Antiochus Epiphanes\|Antiochus Epiphanes]]
