In [[Sources/The WEB Bible/Revelation/Rev 2\|Revelation 2-3]][[Sources/The WEB Bible/Revelation/Rev 3\|Rev 3]], there are seven letters written to seven churches in [[+/Asia Minor\|Asia Minor]]. These churches were located along a popular circular trade route.[^1] The letters were written to praise and condemn the recipients for their faithfulness and their shortcomings.

The seven churches are [[Atlas/Final Project/Ephesus\|Ephesus]], [[Atlas/Final Project/Smyrna\|Smyrna]], [[Atlas/Final Project/Pergamum\|Pergamum]], [[Atlas/Final Project/Thyatira\|Thyatira]], [[Atlas/Final Project/Sardis\|Sardis]], [[Philadelphia\|Philadelphia]], and [[Laodicea\|Laodicea]].

Ephesus was a prominent commercial and cultural center. In [[Sources/The WEB Bible/Revelation/Rev 2\|Revelation 2]], Jesus calls it the church that had abandoned the love and passion they had to serve Him in the beginning. Even though they were hard-working and constantly testing and rebuking false prophets, they were not longer doing it for the right reasons. They had forgotten that truth and love go together.
