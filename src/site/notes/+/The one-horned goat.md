The single horn between its eyes represents the first king of Greece, Alexander the Great. It rapidly moved from west to east. It's one large horn symbolized Alexander's single leadership. It wanted revenge for the Persian attack. Eventually, it took over the entire world before its horn was split into four.

> **(5)** As I was considering, behold, a male goat came from the west over the surface of the whole earth, and didn't touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes. 
> **(6)** He came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power. 
> **(7)** I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him. There was no one who could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
> **(8)** The male goat magnified himself exceedingly. When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of the sky.
