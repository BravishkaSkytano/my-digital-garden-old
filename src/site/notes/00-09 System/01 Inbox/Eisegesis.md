From Ancient Greek εἰς (eis, “into”) and English [[00-09 System/01 Inbox/Exegesis\|Exegesis]]. Historically unrelated to the Ancient Greek εἰσήγησις (eisḗgēsis, “proposing, advising”).

An interpretation, especially of Scripture, that reflects the personal ideas or viewpoint of the interpreter; reading something into a text that is not there.
