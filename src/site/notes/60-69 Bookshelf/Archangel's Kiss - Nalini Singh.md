## Archangel's Kiss

### Description

In this Guild Hunter novel, New York Times bestselling author Nalini Singh returns to her world of angelic rulers, vampiric servants, and the woman thrust into their darkly seductive world... Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux wakes from a year-long coma to find herself changed—an angel with wings of midnight and dawn—but her fragile body needs time to heal before she can take flight. Her lover, the stunningly dangerous archangel Raphael, is used to being in control—especially when it comes to the woman he considers his own. But Elena has never done well with authority... They’ve barely begun to learn each other when Raphael receives an invitation to a ball from the archangel Lijuan. To refuse would be a sign of fatal weakness, so Raphael must ready Elena for the flight to Beijing—and to the nightmare that awaits. For ancient and without conscience, Lijuan’s power lies with the dead. And she has organized the most perfect and most vicious of welcomes for Elena...

- “The longer you live, the more mistakes you make. And the more sorrows you carry.”
- “Do you think you have the right to give me orders now?”
		  The Archangel of New York, a creature so lethal that part of her feared him even now, lifted the hair off her nape, brushed his lips across her skin. "Of course. You are mine." No hint of humor, nothing but stark possession.
		  "I don't think you've quite got the hang of this true love thing.
- “Fathers and mothers,” she found herself saying, “leave their mark, no matter if we’ve known them a lifetime or only a day.”
