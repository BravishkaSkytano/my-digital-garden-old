The book of Daniel is key to the entire Old Testament prophetic revelation. Who better to help you understand Daniel’s stories, prophecies, and dreams—and give you a brighter hope for things to come—than John F. Walvoord, one of evangelicalism’s most prominent leaders, and Charles Dyer, a Bible professor and expert on Israel? In this second work of a renewed series of commentaries, Dr. Walvoord addresses alleged historical inaccuracies and considers past and future fulfillments of specific prophecies. At key points different views and approaches to interpretation are explored. Walvoord devotes special attention to textual and doctrinal issues while avoiding technical language. Refined, updated with the English Standard Version (ESV), and streamlined, this classic text is set to help you understand and interpret the book of Daniel and gain a better grasp of what the future may bring.

> Keil observes, “in the Bundehesch the guardian spirit of the Persian kingdom appears under the form of a ram with clean feet and sharppointed horns, and … the Persian king, when he stood at the head of his army, bore, instead of the diadem, the head of a ram.”16 The references to beasts, as Keil states, “represent kingdoms and nations.”17

> Cumont has noted that different lands were assigned to the signs of the Zodiac according to astronomical geography. In this view, Persia is thought of as under the zodiacal sign of Aries, the “ram,” and Greece as sharing with Syria—the principal territory of the Seleucid monarchy—the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, the “goat.”

> Interpreters of Daniel 8 are generally agreed that the male goat represents the king of Greece. More particularly, the single important horn between its eyes, “the first king” (cf. Dan. 8:21), is Alexander the Great. All the facts about this goat and his activities obviously anticipate Alexander’s dynamic role. Like Alexander, the goat’s conquests begin “from the west” in Greece and move east to cover the entire territory. The tremendous speed of the goat’s conquests is symbolized by its moving “without touching the ground.” Such speed characterized Alexander. The unusual horn— one large horn instead of the normal two—symbolically represents the single leadership he provided.

> The great horn between his eyes was broken just when the goat had reached the pinnacle of his strength. Out of this grew four horns described as being “toward the four winds of heaven.” Expositors, both liberal and conservative, have interpreted this verse as representing the untimely death of Alexander and the division of his empire into four major sections.25

> Practically all commentators recognize the four horns as symbolic of the four kingdoms of the Diadochi which emerged as follows: (1) Cassander assumed rule over Macedonia and Greece; (2) Lysimachus took control of Thrace, Bithynia, and most of Asia Minor; (3) Seleucus took Syria and the lands to the east including Babylonia; (4) Ptolemy established rule over Egypt and possibly Palestine and Arabia Petraea.27

> These conquests, of course, were confirmed in the history of Syria, especially under Antiochus Epiphanes, the eighth king in the Syrian dynasty who reigned 175–164 B.C. (1 Macc. 1:10; 6:16). Antiochus conducted military expeditions in relation to all of these areas.

> Up to verse 11, it is not difficult to find fulfillment of the vision in the history of the Medo-Persian, Alexandrian, and post-Alexandrian periods. Beginning with verse 11, however, expositors have differed widely as to whether the main import of the passage refers to Antiochus Epiphanes, with complete fulfillment in his lifetime, or whether the passage either primarily or secondarily refers also to the end of the age, that is, the period of great tribulation preceding Christ’s second coming.

> If the many divergent views can be simplified, they fall into three general classifications. The critical view that Daniel was a second century forgery regards this prophecy as simply history written after the fact and completely fulfilled in Antiochus Epiphanes.32 Second is the view that this is genuine sixth-century B.C. prophecy, but completely fulfilled historically in Antiochus Epiphanes.33 Third is the view that the prophecy is genuine prediction fulfilled historically in the second century B.C., but also typical and anticipatory of the final conflict between God and Gentile rulers at the time of Israel’s persecution prior to Christ’s return.34 The ultimate decision must rest not simply on verses 11 through 14, but also on the interpretation of the prophecy given in verses 20–26.

> Although it is not necessary to take the expression “the place of his sanctuary was overthrown” as meaning Antiochus destroyed the temple itself, it is of interest that in 1 Maccabees 4:42ff., when the sanctuary was cleansed, the Jews tore down the altar and built a new one. “Apparently Antiochus did not actually tear down the temple, although eventually he desecrated it to such a point that it was hardly fit for use.”37

> The obvious parallel between the cessation of the daily sacrifice by Antiochus Epiphanes and that anticipated in Daniel 9:27, which occurs three and one-half years before the second coming of Christ, has led some expositors to find here evidence for reference to the end of the age and not simply to Antiochus. As far as this prophecy is concerned, however, it did have complete fulfillment in Antiochus.

> Twenty-three-hundred days is less than seven years of 360 days, and the half figure of 1,150 days is short of the three and one-half years of the great tribulation. A safe course to follow is to find fulfillment in Antiochus Epiphanes, and then proceed to consider what eschatological or unfilled prophecy may be involved.

> Archer’s second point is significant because it is easier to fit the potential fulfillment of the prophecy into the disruption of temple sacrifices by Antiochus if it refers to a period of 1,150 days: Consequently we are to understand v. 14 as predicting the rededication of the temple by Judas Maccabaeus on 25 Chislev (or 14 December) 164 B.C.; 1,150 days before that would point to a terminus a quo of three years, one month, and 25 days earlier, or in Tishri 167 B.C. While the actual erection of the idolatrous altar in the temple took place in Chislev 167, or one month and 15 days later, there is no reason to suppose the Antiochus Epiphanes’ administrators may not have abolished the offering of the tāmîd itself at that earlier date.45

> Four major views emerge: (1) the historical view that all of Daniel 8 has been fulfilled; (2) the futuristic view, the idea that it is entirely future; (3) the view based upon the principle of dual fulfillment of prophecy, that Daniel 8 is intentionally a prophetic reference both to Antiochus Epiphanes, now fulfilled, and to the end of the age and the final world ruler who persecutes Israel before the second advent; and (4) the view that the passage is prophecy, historically fulfilled but intentionally typical of similar events and personages at the end of the age.

> Pusey points out, “In the Grecian empire, the little horns issue, not from the empire itself, but from one of its four-fold divisions…. Antiochus Epiphanes came out of one of the four kingdoms of Alexander’s successors, and that kingdom existed in him, as the fourth horn issued in the little horn. But in the fourth empire, the horn proceeds, not out of any one horn, but out of the body of the empire itself. It came up among them the horns, wholly distinct from them, and destroyed three of them.

> While there are obvious similarities between the two little horns of Daniel 7 and 8, the differences are important. If the fourth kingdom represented by Daniel 7 is Rome, then obviously the third kingdom represented by the goat in chapter 8 is not Rome. Their characteristics are much different as they arise from different beasts, their horns differ in number, and the end result is different. The messianic kingdom according to Daniel 7 was going to be erected after the final world empire. This is not true of the period following the goat in chapter 8. The rule that similarities do not prove identity applies here. There are many factors that contrast the two chapters and their contents.

> Some expositors have posited a dual fulfillment, in which prophecy fulfilled in part in the past also foreshadows a future event that will completely fulfill the passage.
